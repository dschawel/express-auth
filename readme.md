# Express Auth - With OAuth

This is some boilerplate code for projects. This is a bare bones node/express app with local user authentication, Facebook OAuth, and Github OAuth.  It exists so that *I don't have to start from scratch on my projects*.

## What it includes

* OAuth for Facebook and Github
* Passport and passport-local for authentication
* Sequelize user model / migration
* Settings for PostgreSQL
* Sessions to keep user logged in between pages
* Flash messages for errors and successes
* Passwords that are hashed with BCrypt
* EJS Templating and EJS Layouts

## Steps To Use

####1. Clone this repo, but with a different name

```
git clone <repo_link> <new_name>
```

#### EXTRA STEP

Switch to the `with-oauth` branch!

````
git checkout with-oauth
````

#### 2. Install node modules from package.json

````
npm install
````
(Or just `npm i` for short)

#### 3. Customize with new project name

Remove defaulty type stuff. Some areas to consider are:

* Title in `layout.ejs`
* Logo in NavBar
* Description/Repo Link in `package.json`
* Remove boilerplate's README content and replace with new project's readme

#### 4. Create a new database for the new project 

````
createdb <new_db_name>
````

#### 5. Update `config.json`

* Change the database name
* Other settings are likely okay, but check username, password, and dialect

#### 6. Check the models and migrations for relevance to your project's needs

For example, if your project doesn't require a birthdate field, then don't keep that in there. 

Delete from both the model and the migration.

#### 7. Run the migrations

````
sequelize db:migrate
````

#### 8. Add a `.env` file with the following fields

* SESSION_SECRET: Can be any random string; usually a hash in production
* BASE_URL
* FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID
* FACEBOOK_SECRET
* GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
* GITHUB_SECRET

Note: Create NEW apps on Facebook and Github for new projects

Note: If NOT using OAuth for Facebook and/or Github, switch to the directions on the `master` branch for local auth ONLY.

#### 9. Run server; make sure it works

````
nodemon
````

or 

````
node index.js
````

#### 10. Create a NEW repository on Github for the new project to live

* Create a new repository on your personal Github account (via the GUI)
* Delete the old remote to origin (`git remote remove origin`)
* Add the new repo link as a remote location you can push to(`git remote add origin <new_link>`)
* Add, Commit, and Push
    * `git add -A`
    * `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
    * `git push origin master`

Note: Don't make the commits from the new project to your auth boilerplate. Keep it PRISTINE for other future projects!
